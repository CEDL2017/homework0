# Leon A. Gatys
He is a PhD student in Bethge lab of Centre for Integrative Neuroscience, an university in Deutschland. One of his famous works is "Image Style Transfer". In this work, he and his coworkers tried to apply the painting style onto the photos. For example, they have tried to apply Van Gogh's painting style on to photo. the result shows in below.

My first time to know this people is the time I was working on one of my college project about hand writing style transfer. We want to transfer the normal handwriting into Chinese calligraphy. At that time, we gave it a try to apply his work on our project. The result was not so outstanding. Even it is pretty bad. But I was fascinated by the magic he did in his project. He inspired me to dig into the related knowledge about Neural Networks and deep learning.

Now, he is working about inferring the neural organization of visual perception from hight-performing convolution neural networks.
