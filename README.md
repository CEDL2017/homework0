# Sepp Hochreiter
## Career profile
Sepp Hochreiter born Josef Hochreiter in 1967 is a German computer scientist.

Since 2006 he has been head of the Institute of Bioinformatics at the Johannes Kepler University of Linz.

He was at the Technical University of Berlin, at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and at the Technical University of Munich.

## The field of expertise
Sepp Hochreiter has made numerous contributions in the fields of machine learning and bioinformatics.



## Scientific contributions
### LSTM
Sepp Hochreiter developed the long short-term memory (LSTM) for which the first results were reported in his diploma thesis in 1991.

LSTM overcomes the problem of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and deep networks to forget information over time or through layers (vanishing or exploding gradient).

LSTM learns from training sequences to process new sequences in order to produce an output or generate an output sequence.

LSTM cells solved numerous tasks in automatic music composition, machine translation, speech recognition, reinforcement learning, and robotics.
