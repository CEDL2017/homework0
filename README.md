# Fei-Fei Li Ph.D.

# Motivation
When I was a freshman, I liked to watch TEDs. One day, while browsing videos, I saw a Chinese woman talking about AI. Most of the talk was quite ordinary. However, I was shocked by the ending. I've already had a passion in neural network since high school, but what I didn't know was that AI already had the ability to describe the content of a picture. It was unbelievable for me at that time, even somewhat today. Years later, the part of the video I mentioned as "ordinary" isn't ordinary at all. It is the development of ImageNet. Dr. Fei-Fei Li is one of the people who makes me get involved in DL. Here's the TED Talk.
