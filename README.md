## Yann LeCun


[Yann LeCun](yann.lecun.com) is a computer scientist mainly contributs in machine learning, computer vision, mobile robotics, and computational neuroscience.  He's the dircetor of [Facebook AI research](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research-fair/) and a professor at NYU.


Yann LeCun was born in France. He recieved a PhD in CS from Universite Pierre et Marie Curie where he proposed an early form of the back-propagation learning algorithm for nerual nets. 


He joined Adaptive Systems Research Department at At&T Bell Laboratories in 1988. At there, he developed many new machine learning methods. He is well known for his works on CNN. He is the one who first applied backpropagation to cnn([Backpropagation Applied to Handwritten Zip Code](yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-89e.pdf)) in 1989, which largely inspired later works on neural networks.  Furthermoere, the propose of Lenet-5([Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition](yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf), with Yoshua Bengio), which was a breakthrough in handwriting and OCR. 


He joined At&T Labs-Research as head of Image Processing Research Department and worked on [DjVu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DjVu)(a computer file format using compression).


After that, he joined NTU in 2003, and became the director of facebook Fair in 2013.


In 2013, Yann LeCun co-founed the [ICLR](www.iclr.cc)(International Conference on Learning Representations) with Yoshua Bengio.

To sum up, Yann LeCun is a remarkable researcher on his research area. He proposed many inspiring works, and is still making contributions to ml, cv, and computational neurosciences.
