## Hugo Larochelle (http://www.dmi.usherb.ca/~larocheh/index_en.html)

### Hugo Larochelle is a research scientist at Google Brain and a adjunct professor at Université de Sherbrooke. He obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science at Université de Montréal, under the supervision of professor Yoshua Bengio. Before joining the Computer Science department of Université de Sherbrooke, he spent two years in the machine learning group at University of Toronto, where he was a postdoctoral fellow under the supervision of Geoffrey Hinton.

### He published his neural network & deep learning tutorial videos online (https://www.youtube.com/user/hugolarochelle/playlists). These tutorial not only explain the mathematical aspects well, but also explicate the practical intuitions and the computation issues that we will face to when tackling with real-world problems and data. It's a well resources and inspiration espacial for the deep learning learners.
