## About

Sebastian Ruder is a 3rd year PhD Student in **Natural Language Processing** and **Deep Learning** at the [Insight Research Centre for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org/) and a research scientist at Dublin-based text analytics startup [AYLIEN](https://aylien.com/). He is interested in transfer and multi-task learning for NLP and democratising machine learning and AI. 
He has studied [Computational Linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics) at the [University of Heidelberg, Germany](http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/index_e.html) and at [Trinity College, Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/). During his studies, he has worked with [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-tw/), [IBM's Extreme Blue](http://www-01.ibm.com/employment/us/extremeblue/), [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/), and [SAP](https://www.sap.com/index.html), among others.

## Blogs

The link of his blog is [here](http://ruder.io/index.html#open). He has blogged about Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP. 

## Newsletter

He has written the newsletter for NLP lately. You can subscribe from [this link](http://newsletter.ruder.io/). The newsletter will show the newest slides, resources, blog posts, paper, codes, datasets, conference, and even industry insights about NLP. I've subscribed it and it's really helpful for learning new things about NLP.
