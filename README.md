The deep learning expert I am going to introduce is Jonathan Long.

Jonathan Long is a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley, working on computer vision and advised vby Trevor Darrell.
Before 2010, he studied Computer Science, Physics, and Mathematics at Carnegie Melleon.

Jonathan focus on algorithms that learn to decode perceptual input into useful information. 
Also, he is a developer of Caffe.

When speaking about Semantic Segmentation, we can never forget Fully Convolutional Networks(FCN). FCN won the best paper honor in CVPR 2015 and Jonathan Long is the person who received this award. Before getting the honor of best paper in CVPR, he had submitted a paper in NIPS and accepted in 2014.
