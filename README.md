Introduction:
Jürgen Schmidhuber is currently the Scientific Director of the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA in Switzerland, professor of Artificial Intelligence at the Faculty of Computer Science at the University of Lugano (USI), Co-Founder and Chief Scientist of NNAISENSE, which is a company aims to market general-purpose Artificial Intelligence.

In academics, professor Jürgen Schmidhuber is one of the authors of LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory), which has a huge influence in machine learning and has benefited billions of people by applications like Google Translations. He is also a big fan of Recursive Neural Network. He has a great achievement in Computer vision as well. He didn't participate in ImageNet competitions, focusing instead on challenging contests with larger images, like medical images. Their team won the first place in IJCNN Traffic Sign Recognition Competition of INI/RUB, which is the first superhuman pattern recognition result in the history of computer vision. The network architecture of ImageNet 2012 winner is similar to Schmidhuber's model in IJCNN 2011.

Professor Jürgen Schmidhuber lives in Switzerland now and therefore is less famous compared to many other professors or researchers who live North America. He described himself as a scientist who aims to build a self-improving Artificial Intelligence smarter than himself. According to Google Scholar, his h index is 77 in total.
