Michael Jordan, is a renowned statistician from Berkeley. He is the Pehong Chen Distinguished Professlor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the Department of Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley. Before that, he taught at MIT.

Michael has much experience in probabilistic graphical models, spectral methods, natural language processing and statistical genetics. He is a leading figure in machine learning and Bayesian nonparametrics and also a gifted teacher, both he and his student's are luminaries in the world of machine learning. A well known expert Andrew Ng is also on this list.

Michael is currently in the context of the AMP(Algorithms, Machines, People) Lab, which is working at the intersection of three massive trends: powerful machine learning, cloud computing, and crowdsourcing. He has lots of awesome publications, such as `Scaling Up Crowd-Sourcing to Very Large Datasets: A Case for Active Learning`, `Automating Model Search for Large Scale Machine Learning`, `A Linearly-Convergent Stochastic L-BFGS Algorithm`, `SparkNet: Training Deep Networks on Spark`, `CYCLADES: Conflict-free Asynchronous Machine Learning`, and more.
