# Other Contributions
< AlphaGo >
AlphaGo is a narrow AI computer program that plays the board game Go. It was developed by Alphabet Inc.'s Google DeepMind in London in October 2015.<br>
It became the first Computer Go program to beat a human professional Go player without handicaps on a full-sized 19×19 board. In March 2016, it beat Lee Sedol in a five-game match, the first time a computer Go program has beaten a 9-dan professional without handicaps. Although it lost to Lee Sedol in the fourth game, Lee resigned the final game, giving a final score of 4 games to 1 in favour of AlphaGo. In recognition of the victory, AlphaGo was awarded an honorary 9-dan by the Korea Baduk Association. It was chosen by Science as one of the Breakthrough of the Year runners-up on 22 December 2016. 
In the 2017 Future of Go Summit, AlphaGo beat Ke Jie, the world No.1 ranked player at the time, in a three-game match. After this, AlphaGo was awarded professional 9-dan by Chinese Weiqi Association. After the match between AlphaGo and Ke Jie, AlphaGo retired while DeepMind continues AI research in other areas. 
AlphaGo uses a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to find its moves based on knowledge previously "learned" by machine learning, specifically by an artificial neural network (a deep learning method) by extensive training, both from human and computer play.

# Comments
I think Dr.Huang is really an extroadinary researcher, mainly because he's the Ph.D originated from Taiwan. He proves that it can still have huge contribution on the computer science in Taiwan. I hope that I can have such ahievement someday in the future.ve
