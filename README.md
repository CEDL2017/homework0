## About his work & publications
### 1. ICNet for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation on High-Resolution Images
![](https://hszhao.github.io/projects/icnet/figures/icnet.png)
![ICNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08545) provide in-depth analysis of their framework and introduce the cascade feature fusion to quickly achieve high-quality segmentation. Their system yields `inference` on a single GPU card with decent quality results evaluated on challenging Cityscapes dataset.
### 2. Pyramid Scene Parsing Network

***IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017***  
![PSPNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01105) came first in ImageNet 2016 scene parsing challenge, PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark and Cityscapes benchmark. A single PSPNet yields the new record of mIoU accuracy 85.4% on PASCAL VOC 2012 and accuracy 80.2% on Cityscapes.
