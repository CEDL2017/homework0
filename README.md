## Evan Shelhamer

## Intoduction
Evan Shelhamer is a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley advised by Professor Trevor Darrell as a member of Berkeley AI Research.
He is interested in visual recognition, machine learning, and reinforcement learning with a focus on deep learning.
To be noticed that he is the lead developer of the Caffe framework.
He got his dual degrees in computer science and psychology from UMass Amherst in 2012 and completed an honor thesis with Erik Learned-Miller.
Currently, he is collaborating with Professor Darrell on a Berkeley DeepDrive project.

## Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation
This paper received Honorable Mention prizes in CVPR 2015. He is one of the authors of this paper. 
Although I’m still feeling difficult to understand the details in this paper, I do think this paper made a breakthrough on Deep Learning at that time. Before the paper was presented, people had to resize the input image as dealing the problems like using convnets for semantic segmentation. In other words, solving semantic segmentation problems was restricted to the size of images, which means the pre-processing was needed and limited the development on semantic segmentation.
However, the paper jumped out of the frame. While previous approaches used connected layers, which not only fixed the dimensions but also threw away spatial coordinates, the authors of this paper presented a new idea transforming fully connected layers into convolutional layers. The convolution layers solved all the problems mentioned above. That impressed me a lot. I really appreciate that they think outside the box and hope I could do so while I’m doing researches in the future.

Thank you.
