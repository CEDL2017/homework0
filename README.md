# Thang Luong

# Motivation
  Anyone who is paying attention to Deep Learning researches in NLP especially in Neural Machine Translation, will defintely hear of **Thang Luong**. His most famous work is [Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025). The multiplicative attention mechanism in sequence-to-sequecne training he proposed has already been applied in many Deep Learning tasks in these years.
  Because of my recent research and interest, I recently pay my attention on Deep Learning about NLP tasks mostly.
