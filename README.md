Please write about a deep learning expert in your README.md.
he/she can be a professor (e.g., Yann LeCun), a Ph.D student (e.g., Joseph Chet Redmon), a hacker (e.g., Flood Sung), a researcher (e.g., John Schulman), an enginner (e.g., Soumith Chintala), an entrepreneur (e.g., Matthew Zeiler), etc.

## Geoffrey Hinton

Geoffrey Hinton is an Engineering Fellow at Google where he manage Brain Team Toronto, which is a new part of the Google Brain Team and is located at Google's Toronto office at 111 Richmond Street.
Brain Team Toronto does basic research on ways to improve neural network learning techniques.
He also does pro bono work as the Chief Scientific Adviser of the new Vector Institute.
He is also an Emeritus Professor at the University of Toronto. 



Hinton's research investigates ways of using neural networks for machine learning, memory, perception and symbol processing. He has authored or co-authored over 200 peer reviewed publicationsin these areas.
He was one of the first researchers who demonstrated the use of **generalized back-propagation algorithm for training multi-layer neural networks** that has been widely used for practical applications.
He co-invented Boltzmann machines with David Ackley and Terry Sejnowski .
His other contributions to neural network research include **distributed representations**, **time delay neural network**, mixtures of experts, Helmholtz machines and Product of Experts. In 2007 Hinton coauthored an unsupervised learning paper titled "Unsupervised learning of image transformations".
An accessible introduction to Geoffrey Hinton's research can be found in his articles in Scientific American in September 1992 and October 1993.
Notable former PhD students and postdoctoral researchers from his group include Richard Zemel, Brendan Frey, Radford M. Neal, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Ilya Sutskever, Yann LeCun and Zoubin Ghahramani.
