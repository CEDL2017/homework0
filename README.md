# Song Han 
## Introduction 

![](https://stanford.edu/~songhan/songhan.jpg)
[Song Han](http://stanford.edu/~songhan/) just graduated as a PhD student with Prof. [Bill Dally](http://cva.stanford.edu/billd_webpage_new.html) at Stanford University. Before joining Stanford, Song graduated from Tsinghua University.  Moreover, Song will join MIT EECS as an assistant professor starting summer 2018. His research focuses on energy-efficient deep learning, at the intersection between machine learning and computer architecture. 

## About his works 
Song proposed [Deep Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.00149v5.pdf/) that can compress deep neural networks by an order of magnitude without losing the prediction accuracy. Deep Compression can compress state-of-the art CNNs by 10x–49x and compressed SqueezeNet to only 470KB, which fits fully in on-chip SRAM.

Song proposed a [DSD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04381) training flow that improved that accuracy of a wide range of neural networks. 

Song also designed [EIE: Efficient Inference Engine](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01528v2.pdf), a hardware architecture that can perform inference directly on the compressed sparse model, which saves memory bandwidth and results in significant speedup and energy saving. As a result, EIE is 13x faster and 3000x energy efficient than GPU. His work has been covered by [TheNextPlatform](https://www.nextplatform.com/2015/12/08/emergent-chip-vastly-accelerates-deep-neural-networks/), [TechEmergence](https://www.techemergence.com/a-limitless-pill-for-deep-neural-networks/), [Embedded Vision](https://www.embedded-vision.com/industry-analysis/blog/seeing-dark-and-efficiently) and [O’Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/compressed-representations-in-the-age-of-big-data). His work received the Best Paper Award in [ICLR’16](http://www.iclr.cc/doku.php?id=iclr2016:main).
