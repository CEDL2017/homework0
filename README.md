### Ph.D student: Joseph Chet Redmon

### Introduction
- - -
Joseph Redmon is the author of YOLO(You Only Look Once),and also develop Darknet(i.e.an open source of neural networks in c)
He is a realy interest guy.Although he is major in computer science,after graduation he galloped off to Unalaska, Alaska to work as 
a radio DJ instead of being an engineer.

He does contract work for ZeroCater on other companies on occasion, and  he was heading off to a 
computer science Ph.D. program at the University of Washington.

His research focuses on  machine Learning,computer Vision. Not all his research are serious,some of studies is realy interesting. Like he has
put an open source code which called "Nightmare"."Nightmare" is a project to make resulting images horrific by using deep learning technique.
Maybe someone will think "Nightmare" is useless,but I think the imagination to do this project is realy cool.Even the resulting images are not
adorabal.

Joseph Redmon was also giving a speech on TED,which had talking about object detection.YOLO is the first objec detection method I haved learned.
Without this opportunity,maybe I will not study in computer vision.
