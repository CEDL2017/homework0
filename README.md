### Introduction
Ian J. Goodfellow obtained his B.S. and M.S. in computer science from Stanford University and his Ph.D. in machine learning from the Université de Montréal (a member of Yoshua Bengio's LISA lab), and developed **Theano** (a Python library for deep learning).

After graduation, Goodfellow joined Google as part of the Google Brain research team. Later he left Google to join the newly founded OpenAI institute. He returned to Google Research in March 2017.

Goodfellow is best known for inventing **_generative adversarial networks (GANs)_**. At Google, he developed a system enabling Google Maps to automatically transcribe addresses from photos taken by Street View cars.

GANs are a very interesting and impressive concept for me. GANs utilize generator/discriminator architecture to decode from a representation to a generated image, and generated images can't be discriminated from real images (adversarial). GANs can generate distribution of images as similar as real one, but may generate unnatural images. Therefore, many papers related to GANs has widely appeared, improved and modified the original GANs.
