## Character introduction：
### Sepp Hochreiter
## Career profile：
Sepp Hochreiter born Josef Hochreiter in 1967 is a German computer scientist.

Since 2006 he has been head of the Institute of Bioinformatics at the Johannes Kepler University of Linz.

He was at the Technical University of Berlin, at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and at the Technical University of Munich.

## The field of expertise：
Sepp Hochreiter has made numerous contributions in the fields of machine learning and bioinformatics.

### In addition to his research contributions, Sepp Hochreiter is broadly active within his field:

He launched the Bioinformatics Working Group at the Austrian Computer Society.

He is founding board member of different bioinformatics start-up companies.

He was program chair of the conference Bioinformatics Research and Development.

He is a conference chair of the conference Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis.

He is editor, program committee member, and reviewer for international journals and conferences.

## Scientific contributions：
### LSTM：
Sepp Hochreiter developed the long short-term memory (LSTM) for which the first results were reported in his diploma thesis in 1991.

LSTM overcomes the problem of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and deep networks to forget information over time or through layers (vanishing or exploding gradient).

LSTM learns from training sequences to process new sequences in order to produce an output or generate an output sequence.

LSTM cells solved numerous tasks in automatic music composition, machine translation, speech recognition, reinforcement learning, and robotics.

LSTM networks are used in Google Voice transcription, Google voice search and Google's Allo as core technology for voice searches and commands in the Google App (on Android and iOS), and for dictation on Android devices. Also Apple applies LSTM since iOS 10 in the "Quicktype" function.

### Deep learning and learning representations：
Sepp Hochreiter's group introduced "exponential linear units" (ELUs) which speed up learning in deep neural networks and lead to higher classification accuracies. Like rectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs), and parametrized ReLUs (PReLUs), ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for positive values. However, ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared to ReLUs, due to negative values which push mean unit activations closer to zero. Mean shifts toward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect.
